**Breast Cancer**
- Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, accounting for one in every four cancer diagnoses in the United States and killing over 40,000 people each year. It is also, after lung cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death in women. Early detection of breast cancer is critical and can improve survival chances.Breast Cancer arises in the lining cells (epithelium) of the ducts (85%) or lobules (15%) in the glandular tissue of the breast. Initially, the cancerous growth is confined to the duct or lobule (“in situ”) where it generally causes no symptoms and has minimal potential for spread (metastasis).
- Breast cancer is the most common cancer, and it is one of the most commonly reported skin cancer types in recent years. The infographics above provide a clear picture of this cancer and its impact on the modern world. Breast Cancer is a current hot-buttom issue in the world of healthcare. The main reason could be our modern, sedentary lifestyle. This type of cancer can affect both men and women, but according to scientific research, women are twice as likely as men to develop breast cancer. That is why it is critical to detect cancer in its early stages.
- Cancer, as most of us know, is defined as uncontrolled cell growth in a specific area. An expert will classify the cells as malignant or benign based on an imaging procedure known as Fine Needle Aspiration. But how can machine learning be used to diagnose breast cancer? That is the burning question of the hour.
Cell characteristics are measured from Fine Needle aspiration images using image processing techniques or manual measurements, and these characteristics are used to classify the cells as benign or cancerous.

- Can we develop a predictive model that accurately classifies tumors as malignant (M) or benign (B) based on the given features (radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, etc.)?
- Are there any strong correlations between pairs of features?
